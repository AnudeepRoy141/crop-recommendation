A RAG based crop recommendation system that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental parameters. The project uses Python, scikit-learn, and a dataset containing features like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The model predicts the best crop for given conditions, helping farmers make data-driven decisions.

## Features

- Predicts optimal crop based on user input
- Utilizes a trained machine learning model (Random Forest)
- Simple CLI or web interface for predictions
- Easy to extend with more data or features

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

**Contributors:**  
- [Anudeep Roy](https://github.com/AnudeepRoy)  
- [Protyay Banerjee](https://github.com/Protyay-Banerjee)  

We both collaborated to create this repository and wrote all the code.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnudeepRoy/crop-recommendation.git
    cd crop-recommendation
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    # To run this Streamlit app, use the following command in your terminal:
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

- Input soil and weather parameters when prompted.
- The system will output the recommended crop.

### Realtime Crop Data (optional)

`data/crop_database.py` can pull realtime crop metadata when these environment variables are set:

- `CROP_API_URL`: HTTPS endpoint returning crop data. Recommended: data.gov.in Agmarknet API
- `CROP_API_KEY`: API key for authorization (used for `Authorization`/`x-api-key`; data.gov.in also expects `api-key` query parameter)
- `CROP_API_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (optional): Cache TTL in seconds, default `900`

Recommended real URL (Agmarknet on data.gov.in):

- Daily prices (records): `https://api.data.gov.in/resource/9ef84268-d588-465a-a308-a864a43d0070?format=json&limit=200&api-key=YOUR_KEY`

Sign up to get an API key: `https://api.data.gov.in/signup/`.

Example run:

```bash
CROP_API_URL="https://api.data.gov.in/resource/9ef84268-d588-465a-a308-a864a43d0070?format=json&limit=200&api-key=$CROP_API_KEY" \
CROP_API_KEY="your_data_gov_in_api_key" \
streamlit run app.py
```

Notes:
- If the API fails or is not configured, the app falls back to the builtâ€‘in static dataset.
- Realtime data are normalized and merged with static defaults (by `name`) to keep required fields intact.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels
- Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall
- Crop label

## Model

- Random Forest Classifier trained on the dataset
- Model accuracy and evaluation metrics available in the notebook
